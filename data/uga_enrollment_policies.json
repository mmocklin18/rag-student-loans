    "question": "Academic Assistance (Learning Support) Courses - UGA Student Financial Aid",
    "answer": "Only the first thirty (30) attempted semester hours of required Academic Assistance (Learning Support) course hours can be counted when determining a student\u2019s Enrollment Status for Federal Student Aid (FSA) purposes. Academic Assistance courses taken on a voluntary basis are not considered in determining a student\u2019s enrollment status for FSA purposes. The HOPE and Zell Miller Scholarships do not pay for any Academic Assistance (Learning Support) courses or any other courses that do not apply toward a degree, neither are these courses included in determining the number of HOPE / Zell Miller Scholarship Attempted Hours , or the HOPE / Zell Miller Scholarship Paid Hours when pursued fall 2011 or later.

    "question": "Unofficial Withdrawal - UGA Student Financial Aid",
    "answer": "Federal policy requires students who have been awarded any type of Federal Student Aid (FSA) to fulfill their academic requirements. If a student fails to earn a passing grade in at least one course he or she enrolled in for a semester, the UGA Office of Student Financial Aid (OSFA) must assume for FSA purposes that the student has unofficially withdrawn, unless it can be documented that the student did complete the term. For example, a student receives all \u201cF\u201d and/or \u201cU\u201d and/or \u201cW\u201d grades for a term. OSFA is required to determine if the student \u201cunofficially withdrew\u201d from the University. An \u201cunofficial withdrawal\u201d occurs when a student stops attending all classes and stops participating in any academic activities beyond the date he/she last attended classes. Depending on the date of the student\u2019s \u201cunofficial withdrawal\u201d, it may be necessary for the University and/or the student to return some or all of the financial aid the student received during the term. At the end of each semester, OSFA will contact the instructors of such students to find out if the student began attendance in the class and had any academic participation, so OSFA can determine if their failure to earn a passing grade during the term constitutes an \u201cunofficial withdrawal\u201d from the University. Unofficially withdrawing from the University can result in the student being required to repay all or a portion of the financial aid received for the term. Also review the Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) policy for information regarding the potential adverse impact of these grades on continued financial aid eligibility.",

    "question": "Dropping a Course(s)",
    "answer": "Dropping a course(s) prior to the last date of the official Drop / Add period results in a reevaluation of the student\u2019s Enrollment Status for Financial Aid Purposes and his or her financial aid eligibility for that term. Credit hours for dropped courses are not included in determining a student\u2019s enrollment status for Federal Student Aid (FSA) . Neither do they count for HOPE and Zell Miller Scholarships or UGA scholarship eligibility determination purposes, nor are they included in determining the student\u2019s Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) . No courses or grades are posted to the student\u2019s academic transcript for dropped hours. Any tuition and any related fee charges for the dropped course(s) are returned to the appropriate financial aid program(s). Student repayment may be required if financial aid was previously disbursed to the student based on the subsequently dropped credit hours. Also see the Office of the Registrar\u2019s Registration Overview for more information about the registration process. Summer Pell Grant recipients should review the \u201cImportant Note\u201d at the bottom of this page.",

    "question": "Withdrawing or being Withdrawn from a Course(s)",

All types of W grades and the course hours associated with them are still considered as attempted hours for the purposes of determining Federal Student Aid (FSA) , State of Georgia aid (such as the HOPE and Zell Miller Scholarships ) and UGA scholarship eligibility, and they are included in both the quantitative and qualitative portions of the financial aid Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) standards.

    "question": "Withdrawing or being Withdrawn from All Courses",
    "answer": "Withdrawing from all courses can affect a student\u2019s financial aid eligibility as cited under the preceding topic. In addition, when a student withdraws or is withdrawn from all his or her courses prior to completing more than 60 percent of the term, federal financial aid regulations generally require the student to repay a portion of the federal student aid received during the term. The amount of any required aid repayment is calculated by UGA Student Accounts according to the federally prescribed formula. Also see the Office of the Registrar\u2019s Policy on Withdrawals for more information about the withdrawal process.",

    "question": "Important Note Regarding Summer Pell Grant",
    "answer": "If a student drops or withdraws from a course prior to the end of the Short Session II drop / add period then that course must be removed from Pell Grant enrollment status. Please review the Office of the Registrar\u2019s Academic Calendar to determine the end of the Short Session II drop / add period. Any classes dropped or withdrawn prior to this date cannot be counted for Pell Grant enrollment status. For example, if you enroll in 12 hours during Summer term and withdraw from 3 hours before the end of the Short Session II drop / add period, you will be considered \u00be time for Pell Grant purposes. This may result in a Pell Grant repayment if you have already received Summer Pell Grant for 12 hours.",

    "question": "Grade Changes & Incomplete (I) Grades - UGA Student Financial Aid",
    "answer": "When a student\u2019s previously posted end of term grade is changed, his or her HOPE / Zell Miller Scholarship Grade Point Average (GPA) is reevaluated as well as the student\u2019s Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) for HOPE / Zell and Federal Student Aid (FSA) . The reevaluation begins with the term to which the grade change applied. If the grade change negatively impacts the student\u2019s HOPE / Zell Miller Scholarship and/or FSA eligibility, the student will be required to repay any affected financial aid already received and any undisbursed aid will be canceled. Although the University\u2019s academic policy provides students up to 12 months to complete an incomplete (I) grade, one or more \u201cI\u201d grades can adversely affect the Minimum 67% Pace of Completion component of Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) . NG grades are posted by the Registrar\u2019s Office when they do not receive a final grade from the instructor.\u00a0 As is the case regarding incomplete grades, one or more \u201cNG\u201d grades can adversely affect the Minimum 67% Pace of Completion component of Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) .

UGA College of Engineering Cooperative Experiential Learning Program (co-op) courses do not apply toward the student\u2019s degree; therefore, they are not counted when determining the total number of credit hours in which a student is enrolled for financial aid purposes. For this reason, students enrolled only in a co-op course(s) are not eligible for financial aid during the semester of co-op enrollment.",
