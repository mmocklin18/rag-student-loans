    "question": "If I have a Perkins loan and I am interested in Public Service Loan Forgiveness, what do I need to know?",
    "answer": "If you work in certain public service professions and have a Perkins loan, you may be eligible for a different benefit called Perkins loan cancellation available at the end of five years of service.\n\nWith Perkins loan cancellation, for each complete year of service, a percentage of the loan may be canceled. The total percentage of the loan that can be canceled depends on the type of public service you perform.\n\nIf you choose to consolidate a Perkins loan into a federal Direct Consolidation Loan to become eligible for Public Service Loan Forgiveness , you will no longer be eligible for Perkins loan cancellation. More information about Perkins loan cancellation is available on the Federal Student Aid website ."

    "question": "What are income-driven repayment (IDR) plans, and how do I qualify?",
    "answer": "With an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan, you can make lower monthly payments on your federal student loans based on your income and family size.\n\nIf you have a federal student loan, you may be able to enroll in an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan online. If you have older federal loans, you may have to contact your loan servicer directly to enroll. The U.S. Department of Education's online IDR plan enrollment website will tell you what types of loans you have.\n\nSaving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) Plan is the newest income-driven repayment (IDR) plan available for all Direct Loans. It replaced the Revised Pay As You Earn (REPAYE) Plan in 2023. Borrowers on the REPAYE Plan automatically get the benefits of the new SAVE Plan.\n\nAdditionally, the SAVE Plan has an interest benefit. If you make your full monthly payment, but it is not enough to cover the accrued monthly interest, the government covers the rest of the interest that accrued that month. This means that the SAVE Plan prevents your balance from growing due to unpaid interest.\n\nPay As You Earn (PAYE) is a federal student loan repayment plan available to some borrowers with newer federal loans. For borrowers who qualify for PAYE, monthly loan payments are capped at 10 percent of your discretionary income. Additionally, after 20 years of monthly payments, any remaining student loan balance is forgiven. PAYE is also an eligible repayment plan for borrowers seeking to qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness .\n\nIn order to qualify for PAYE, you need to have borrowed your first federal student loan after October 1, 2007, and you need to have borrowed a Direct Loan or a Direct Consolidation Loan after October 1, 2011. To determine whether you qualify for PAYE, check out the Department of Education’s Loan Simulator .\n\nAnother repayment program, Income-Based Repayment (IBR), caps your payment amount at the lower of a certain percentage of your discretionary income or the amount you would pay under the 10-year Standard Repayment Plan. The percentage rate depends on when you took out the loan and if you had existing federal student loans.\n\nThe percentage of your discretionary income will be 10 percent:\n\nThe percentage of your discretionary income will be 15 percent:\n\nYou get a lower payment with IBR if your federal student loan debt is high relative to your income and family size. While your loan servicer will perform the calculation to determine your eligibility, you can use the U.S. Department of Education's Loan Simulator to estimate whether you would likely benefit from an IBR plan.\n\nIf you have a subsidized loan and your monthly IBR payment is less than the interest that accrues each month, the government will pay the difference for the first three years so that your overall balance doesn’t increase. Any remaining loan balances are forgiven after you make payments for 20 or 25 years .\n\nMany borrowers with federal student loans can enroll in IBR online . Your monthly payment adjusts every year based on your income and family size. You must submit documentation to your servicer each year to remain in the IBR program.\n\nThe final income-driven repayment plan, the income contingent repayment plan caps your monthly payment at the lesser of 20 percent of your discretionary income or what you would pay on a fixed repayment plan over the course of 12 years, adjusted according to your income. Any remaining loan balances are forgiven, after you make payments for 25 years .\n\nAny borrower with an eligible federal student loan can make payments under the ICR plan. This plan is the only income-driven repayment option for Parent PLUS loan borrowers. Although Parent PLUS loans cannot be repaid under any income-driven repayment plans, parent borrowers may consolidate their Direct PLUS loans or Federal PLUS loans into a Direct Consolidation loan, which does qualify for the ICR plan.\n\nHere are some ideas for making the most of income-driven repayment."

    "question": "Do I get any benefit from public service loan forgiveness if I leave public service before the required 10 years?",
    "answer": "If you leave public service even one monthly payment short of the required 120 payments, you will not be eligible for PSLF based on the public service you completed. However, if you return to public service, you can pick up where you left off and make payments that count toward loan forgiveness.\n\nTo become eligible for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program you must make a total of 120, qualifying monthly payments.\n\nHowever, these payments do not have to be consecutive. If you leave public service, you can still pick up where you left off and continue down the path to loan forgiveness. If you return to a public service job, you can accrue credit towards the 120 required payments while working for a qualified employer.\n\nIf a payment is no later than 15 days after your due date, or you are in certain periods of deferment or forbearance, in some cases you can still get PSLF credit so long as you can certify you worked full time for a qualifying employer.\n\nYou can make it a habit to submit the PSLF Form electronically every year to record your credits. It’s also a good idea to submit the form prior to ending employment with a public service employer, or change jobs from one qualifying employer to another, since it’s easier to get the form filled out by your employer at that time compared to when you apply for loan forgiveness in the future."

    "question": "What is the best student loan forgiveness option for teachers?",
    "answer": "Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) is often the best option, but there are other student loan forgiveness programs for teachers to consider.\n\nIf you have federal student loans and work as a teacher, you may be eligible for several loan forgiveness options. PSLF allows qualifying federal student loans to be forgiven after 120 qualifying payments for people working in public service, like many teachers.\n\nHighly-qualified teachers in certain low-income schools may be eligible for a different loan forgiveness program, called the Teacher Loan Forgiveness (TLF) Program, that provides $5,000 in loan forgiveness after the completion of five consecutive academic years as an elementary or secondary school teacher. Highly qualified math, science, or special education teachers may be eligible for up to $17,500 in loan forgiveness after the completion of five academic years as a teacher in an eligible school. You can potentially receive forgiveness under both TLF and PSLF but not for the same period of teaching service .\n\nAdditionally, if you have a Federal Perkins loan the program has a cancellation option for teachers ."

    "question": "If I co-sign for my grandchild's student loan, can the lender garnish my Social Security check if they don't repay the loan?",
    "answer": "Private student loan companies are not allowed to garnish your Social Security check. But a lender could take you to court for loans you have co-signed if the primary borrower doesn’t pay them.\n\nCompanies that offer private student loans are not allowed to garnish Social Security checks of co-signers if the borrower doesn’t repay the loan. But the lender can still pursue you and even take you to court to try to collect the amount due on the loan. Keep in mind that private loans do not carry the same consumer protections as federal student loans.\n\nOnly federal student loans can result in garnishment, or offset, of Social Security benefits. However, most federal student loans do not require a co-signer. A biological or adoptive parent (or in some cases, a stepparent) can borrow a certain type of federal student loan called a Direct PLUS loan to help a child pay for college. Grandparents must formally adopt grandchildren to be eligible to apply for Direct PLUS loans.\n\nEncourage your grandchild to explore all federal student aid options before taking out a private loan."

    "answer": "With the Post 9/11 GI Bill, members of the military may be eligible for up to 36 months of educational benefits for college tuition and fees, housing, books and supplies, as well as money to move if you live in a rural area.\n\nThe Post-9/11 GI Bill is a generous educational benefit for servicemembers, veterans, and military families.\n\nThe total benefit you qualify for depends on how much active service you’ve had since September 10, 2001, which is then calculated based on the maximum benefit.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs offers the GI Bill Comparison Tool to help you find out how much you may be eligible to receive. To see the range of possible benefits, answer a few questions about your military status and service, the type of institution and school you plan to attend, as well as whether you plan to take classes in person or online.\n\nThe GI Bill Comparison Tool provides key information about college affordability.

    "question": "What kind of credit inquiry has no effect on my credit score?",
    "answer": "A single credit inquiry from a lender will have little impact on your credit score.\n\nCredit scoring models also take into account that consumers shop around for the best rate on a loan or credit, and they don’t penalize you for comparison shopping. When a lender requests a copy of your credit report, it’s called a credit inquiry . Scoring models generally count multiple credit inquiries as one credit inquiry as long as they take place within a reasonably short period of time.\n\nIn general, credit inquiries within 14 to 45 days of each other for the same type of loan will be treated as no more than a single inquiry. For the most common credit scoring models, student loan, auto loan and mortgage-related inquiries that occur 30 days prior to scoring have no effect at all on your credit score . In addition, when your existing creditors check your credit report, it should not hurt your score.\n\nIf your comparison shopping goes beyond 45 days – or if you’re shopping for two different types of loans such as a mortgage loan and an auto loan – it generally counts as multiple credit inquiries, and it can negatively impact your credit score."

    "question": "What does a school’s financial aid office do?",
    "answer": "The role of a financial aid office is to assist students and their families by providing information on ways to pay for education. They are also involved in giving out financial aid.\n\nIf you need assistance in paying for your college education, reach out to the financial aid office at the same time as the admissions office. Many schools will try and provide you with an estimated financial aid award so you can make an informed enrollment decision.\n\nAdditionally, you can typically go to the financial aid office to:\n\nIn order to receive federal grant aid or borrow federal student loans, you (or your family) must fill out a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) . Your school’s financial aid office will receive your FAFSA information from the U.S. Department of Education, and then they will tell you the type of aid you are awarded and other options. This is generally referred to as your “financial aid offer package.” Your package may include grants and scholarships, work-study, and loans. Your financial aid office will review your student loan application and add your loan funds to your account. It’s a good idea to seek out grants, scholarships, and other money you don’t have to pay back before taking out loans.\n\nIf you choose to take out a private student loan in order to pay for college, your college financial aid office may provide you with a list of possible lenders. Remember, you have the right to shop around for a private student loan that will give you the best rate. There may be other loans or products available to you that are not on the list provided by your financial aid office. For example, your local bank or credit union may offer a loan with a lower interest rate or more favorable terms. In most situations, your financial aid office may need to confirm that you’re enrolled in the school in order for you to get a private student loan.\n\nSome financial aid offices, as well as financial institutions and non-profits, may offer a product called an income share agreement (ISA). An ISA is a private education loan where you promise to make future payments based on a percentage of your income. This means that the higher your salary, the higher your ISA payment. Payment is complete once you have repaid a set amount, or you reached a maximum number of payments. Because an ISA may pose unique risks to borrowers and can often cost more over the life of the loan than traditional student loan products, it is best to max out your federal student loans (if available) and other options—such as scholarships and grants—before you enter into an ISA. If you’re considering taking on more than one ISA, keep in mind that the percentage of your income you agree to pay will be different for each contract, so you are committing an additional percentage of your income with each new agreement. Further, if you already have student loan obligations you will be required to pay those in addition to paying a percentage of your income under the terms of your ISA contract, which may lead to excessive debt. Be sure to read the terms and conditions carefully and fully understand them before opting for an ISA. ISAs are generally subject to federal consumer financial laws."

    "question": "What are the different ways to pay for college or graduate school?",
    "answer": "Financing a college education is a significant investment, and there are a number of options that may help you after college.\n\nYou have choices about how to pay for college. Understanding your options can help you make the right decision for your situation. It’s important to first research how you can pay for college without loans. But if you need additional assistance, it’s generally best to apply for grants, scholarships, and then federal student loans before private loans. Any of these options can be used along with funds from independent higher education savings or a 529 savings plan , an investment account typically sponsored by states for families to save money on future educational costs.\n\nGrants and scholarships are a type of financial aid that doesn’t have to be repaid. Grants are often need-based, while scholarships are usually merit-based.\n\nStart by researching available scholarships and grants and applying for as many as you can. Start early so you can plan ahead and know what other forms of financial assistance you’ll need.\n\nTuition payment plans, also called tuition installment plans, are short-term payment plans that split your college bills into equal monthly payments.\n\nPayment plans generally vary by college or university, but in addition to breaking up the payments, schools usually don’t charge interest. They may, however, have up-front fees or require a larger initial payment than subsequent installments.\n\nThe CFPB has observed varied and sometimes inconsistent disclosure of terms, forced enrollment, high late fees, and consumer right waivers among some tuition payment plan products. Be sure to read the terms and conditions and fully understand them before choosing a tuition payment plan.\n\nFederal work study programs provide part-time jobs for undergraduate and graduate students to help pay for their education expenses. Work study programs are available through your college or university and are based on your school’s funding level, the availability when you apply, and your financial need.\n\nAsk your financial aid office about the options for getting paid for work-study. At most schools, work-study money cannot be used to cover direct costs (like tuition, on-campus housing, and meal plans), because you must pay those bills before you earn the work-study funds.\n\nIncome share agreements (ISAs) are a type of private education loan where you receive money to pay for your education and you promise to make future payments based on a percentage of your income. This means that the higher your salary, the higher your ISA payment. Payment is complete once you have repaid a defined amount, or you have reached a maximum number of payments.\n\nBecause an ISA may pose unique risks to borrowers and can often cost more over the life of the loan than traditional student loan products, it is best to max out your federal student loans (if available) and other options—such as scholarships and grants—before you enter into an ISA. If you’re considering taking on more than one ISA, keep in mind that each one requires a percentage of your income, so you’re committing an additional percentage of your income with each new agreement. Further, if you already have student loan obligations, you will be required to pay those in addition to paying a percentage of your income under the terms of your ISA contract, which may lead to excessive debt. Be sure to read the terms and conditions carefully and fully understand them before opting for an ISA. ISAs are generally subject to federal consumer financial laws.\n\nEven after considering other financial assistance programs, you may still need additional help to pay for college through federal or private student loans.\n\nFederal student loans are made and guaranteed by the Department of Education, including Direct subsidized loans, Direct unsubsidized loans, and PLUS loans . Private student loans, however, are provided by banks, credit unions, and other private lenders–with varying rates and terms–and don’t offer the same protections for consumers.\n\nThrough federal Direct loans, you may also qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) if you work full time for a qualifying public service employer and make 120 qualifying monthly payments. Some income-driven repayment plans , only available for federal student loans, offer forgiveness on remaining loan balances after 10, 20, or 25 years of repayment. Teachers have other forgiveness opportunities under the Teacher Loan Forgiveness Program . If you’re a teacher, learn more about forgiveness options . Again, it’s best to exhaust all of your other options, including applying for the maximum federal student loans you’re eligible for , before shopping for a private student loan."

    "question": "What is a Stafford loan?",
    "answer": "Stafford loans are a type of federal student loan that are either subsidized, meaning the government pays the interest while you're in school, or unsubsidized, meaning you pay all the interest.\n\nStafford loans are a type of loan issued under the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP). The FFEL Program ended in July 2010, which stopped the issuing of new Subsidized Federal Stafford Loans and Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans. All federal loans are now made through the Federal Direct Loan Program .\n\nToday people may still misuse the term Stafford Loan when discussing Federal Direct Loans. This is not the correct name since Stafford Loans ended in 2010. A Stafford Loan and a Federal Direct Loan are not the same. If you are currently applying for a new loan and your school uses the term Stafford Loan, they are talking about a Federal Direct Loan. However, if you attended school before July 2010, you may have a Stafford Loan and are still required to pay those loans.\n\nRepayment on all Stafford loans typically begins six months after you graduate, withdraw, or drop below half-time enrollment. Borrowers of Stafford Loans under the FFEL Program qualify for three repayment options:\n\nIf you have trouble making your payment or if you want to have lower monthly payments over a longer period, you can look into a Direct Consolidation Loan to become eligible for alternative repayment plans , including PSLF. Eligibility for Public Service Loan Forgiveness is depended on whether you have a FFELP loan or a Direct Loan, as FFELP loans (like the Stafford Loan) do not qualify,"

    "question": "Should I consolidate or refinance my student loans?",
    "answer": "The options for consolidating your student loans vary depending on whether you are consolidating into a federal Direct Loan or a private student loan. There are benefits and downsides to each.\n\nThe type of consolidation loans available to you depends on whether you have federal or private student loans .\n\nIf you have federal student loans, you have the option to combine some or all of your federal student loans into a Federal Direct Consolidation Loan (Direct Consolidation Loan). If you consolidate non-direct loans into a Direct Loan, you gain certain federal protections and benefits such as Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF), which can eliminate your balance after 120 qualifying payments (10 years).\n\nA Direct Consolidation Loan has a fixed interest rate that’s the weighted average of the interest rates of the loans being consolidated, rounded up to the nearest one-eighth of a percent. While consolidating your loans may slightly increase your interest rate, it will lock you into a fixed rate, so your new payment won’t change over time, if they’re based on a standard repayment plan. Note that original Direct Loans, if issued after mid-2006, also have a fixed interest rate, but loans issued before that may not.\n\nIf you have private student loans, you don’t have the same protections or benefits as federally funded loans, but you can consolidate multiple loans into one private loan or refinance your loans to get a better interest rate.\n\nConsolidation allows you to combine all or some of your private and federal student loans into one large private consolidation loan through a private lender or bank. Refinancing your existing private student loans would allow you to get into a new private loan at a lower interest rate, especially during periods of low interest rates.\n\nKeep in mind that private student loans can be either fixed or variable interest rates, and the rates you’re offered are based on your credit history. If you take out a private student loan as a student, you may have a limited credit profile, and as a result, the interest rates tend to be higher. However, once you’ve graduated and get a job, you can built up your credit , which may allow you to get a new loan at a lower interest rate.\n\nRefinancing or consolidating your existing private student loans into a new private loan, might allow you to:\n\nIt is important, though, to evaluate the terms of a potential private refinance loan carefully before making your decision. Here are some things to consider:\n\nIf you’re considering consolidating federal student loans into a private consolidation loan, keep in mind that you will lose the federal loan’s benefits and protections. Weigh the benefits and risks since this type of consolidation can’t be reversed.\n\nIf you have equity in your home, you may find that paying back outstanding student debt with a new home equity loan or HELOC looks appealing, but putting more debt on your home can lead to problems down the road.\n\nBefore you take out a home equity loan to pay off a student loan, look first for a student loan refinance product and see what rate you can get. You may be able to lower your interest rate without some of the risks that come with tapping the equity in your home. Here are a few things to consider:\n\nFor student borrowers with plenty of savings for a rainy day, a steady income, and a solid understanding of the tax benefits, a home equity loan may offer an opportunity to pay off your student loans at a lower interest rate. But there is always a risk of losing your home if you don’t make your payments."

    "answer": "If you must take out student loans, federal student loans are the best option for the vast majority of borrowers since they have fixed interest rates and more protections.\n\nIt is best to max out your federal student loan options before you borrow any private student loans. Federal student loans usually carry more flexible protections if you run into difficulty in repaying your loans, and all new federal student loans have fixed interest rates, meaning the rate does not change over the life of your loan. Private student loans may have variable interest rates, which can reset every month or quarter, causing your monthly payments to change.\n\nIf you are a graduate or professional student, there are rare cases where a private loan could be a better option than a Federal Grad PLUS loan . This may occur if you:\n\nIf all of these apply to you, you may want to consider private student loan options instead of Federal Grad PLUS loans since a private loan may have a lower initial interest rate.

A number of factors determine the interest rates on private student loans.\n\nFederal student loans borrowed on or after July 1, 2006, have fixed interest rates. That means the interest rate does not change over the life of the loan. Interest rates for federal student loans depend on the type of loan and year the loan is disbursed. Federal student loan rates are set on an annual basis by federal law.\n\nTo view current interest rates for federal student loans as well as previous years’ interest rates visit the U.S. Department of Education’s website .\n\nPrivate student loans do not have the same interest rates as federal student loans. A private student loan lender determines your interest rate based on factors such as your credit history, the school you are attending, and your course of study.\n\nPrivate student loans may have a variable interest rate that changes over time, so your payments may not be the same from month to month. A fixed interest rate loan will not change over the life of the loan, so your interest rate and payment will not change.\n\nYour lender must tell you about your rates.

For private student loans, you can shop around at different lenders.\n\nDo your homework to understand your options. Look for student loan options beyond what your school provides, and always verify information presented by your school’s financial aid office with the lenders.\n\nIf you’re still in high school, you can reach out to your high school career planning or guidance counselor office for information about both private and federal student loans.\n\nReach out to your college’s or university’s financial aid office for information about your federal student loan options . Additionally, you can call the U.S. Department of Education’s Federal Student Aid Information Center at 1-800-4FED-AID (1-800-433-3243).\n\nFor private student loans, you can shop around at different lenders, including banks, credit unions, or other student loan providers. A good practice is to get quotes from at least three different providers. You might first consult your local credit union or bank, if you or your family hold an account there. Your college financial aid office may also provide you with a list of possible lenders and answer your questions."

    "question": "How much should I borrow in student loans?",
    "answer": "If you have to take out student loans, try to only borrow what you need to cover the cost of your education. A good guideline is to limit your borrowing to what your future earnings will allow you to repay; however, this might not be possible for all students.\n\nWhen deciding how much you should borrow in student loans, it helps to start with a budget for not only the school year but for your total expected time in school. For each additional year that you are in school and take out student loans, your total debt will continue to increase.\n\nIf possible, try not to accumulate more total student debt than you expect to earn as a starting annual salary when you leave school. This might not be feasible for all students.\n\nCheck out our web tool, Your financial path to graduation , to explore salaries for different programs and majors and what you might expect to earn after graduation. This tool will help you understand your financial aid offer and access the full cost of college. It will also help you estimate how much you’ll owe and determine if you can afford that debt.\n\nYou are not obligated to borrow the maximum loan amount that you’re offered. Depending on your circumstances and your work earnings and other income, try to borrow just enough to fully pay for your tuition, housing, and other expenses. Some students who don’t have access to other financial support may want to consider taking out the maximum loan amount offered; however, that might not be the right call for all borrowers.\n\nKeep track of how much you are borrowing . As you continue to borrow additional student loans each year you are in school, keep track of your total student debt. Maintain your own copy of all documents and transaction entries. The definitive source for your current loan balances on all of your federal student loans is the U.S. Department of Education’s Federal Student Aid website. Through this website, you can access information about your federal student loans. Your college financial aid office or your lender will have more information about your private student loan balances."

    "question": "When and how do I start paying my student loans?",
    "answer": "For most federal student loans, you will start making payments six months after you graduate, leave school, or drop below half-time enrollment in school. For private student loans, your lender or servicer should provide you with information on when and how to pay your loan.\n\nMost federal loans have a \"grace period.\" This is a time after you graduate, leave school, or when you drop below half-time school enrollment when you don't have to make payments . For most loans, interest will continue to grow during your grace period.\n\nThe definitive source for your current federal student loan balances, including information about whom to pay and when, is the U.S. Department of Education’s Federal Student Aid website.\n\nTowards the end of your grace period you will want to decide whether or not to consolidate your federal student loans , determine your repayment plan, and determine whether to enroll in autopay. When you make payments, you will make them to your loan servicer. If you don’t know who your loan servicer is, you can find out by accessing your StudentAid.Gov account .\n\nYour private student lender or servicer should reach out to you about your loan payments. This can come in the form of an email or a billing statement that is mailed to you each month. Some lenders provide a “welcome kit” or phone call when a borrower enters repayment. Contact your loan servicer for more information.\n\nIf you’re not sure who your loan servicer is, check your original loan paperwork (such as a promissory note or disbursement notice). If you can’t find those papers, check your credit report for your lender’s name or contact your school’s financial aid office to assist you in locating your lender or servicer."

    "url": "https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/how-does-interest-accrue-while-i-am-in-school-en-593/",
    "question": "How does interest accrue while I am in school?",
    "answer": "For subsidized federal student loans, your interest is paid by the U.S. government while you’re in school. For most other loans, interest continues to accrue, so you will owe more than you borrowed by the time you leave school.\n\nInterest accrued while you’re in school can be “capitalized,” meaning it is added to your loan’s unpaid principal balance. When capitalization occurs, you are charged interest on interest.\n\nFor example, if you borrow $5,000 at a 10% annual rate for a 12-month program, then you will accrue $500 while you’re in school and $250 during the six-month grace period, for a total of $750 in accrued interest by the end of the grace period. Capitalization adds that $750 to the principal balance, for a total of $5,750. Interest will continue to accrue from $5,750.\n\nCapitalization occurs at specific times . For example, the interest on federal loans capitalizes when a period of deferment ends on an unsubsidized loan. If you are under an income-based repayment (IBR) plan and you no longer qualify or if you leave the plan, unpaid interest capitalizes. Private loans typically capitalize when the grace period, deferment, or forbearance ends. Consult your lender for details about interest on your student loans."

    "question": "What happens to my student loans if I die or become disabled?",
    "answer": "If you meet certain requirements, your federal student loans may be canceled if you become disabled or pass away. Private student loans, however, have different provisions.\n\nIn the horrible event that you become totally and permanently disabled or pass away, your student loans may be canceled or discharged. However, the requirements vary depending on whether the loans are federal or private.\n\nYou may qualify for student loan discharge, relieving you from having to repay the remainder of your loan, if you meet the Department of Education’s requirements for being totally and permanently disabled. If you are approved for total and permanent disability (TPD) discharge through Social Security Administration documentation or a medical professional’s certification, you will be subject to a three-year post-discharge monitoring period .\n\nIf you have federal student loans and pass away, the loans won’t transfer to another person. Relatives can notify the loan servicer, and the loan will be canceled.\n\nUnlike federal student loans, private student lenders are not legally required to cancel private student loans for borrowers who die or become disabled. Because of this, in some instances, private student loan debt may pass on to a spouse or cosigner of the loan.\n\nIn certain cases, private lenders have special provisions to discharge loans, but it’s important to check the terms and conditions of your loan or contact your servicer for more details."

    "url": "https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/should-i-consolidate-my-federal-loans-en-603/",
    "question": "Should I consolidate my federal student loans into a federal Direct Consolidation Loan?",
    "answer": "Before choosing to consolidate your federal student loans make sure you understand the risks.\n\nLoan consolidation can qualify you for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF), give you access to different repayment options, help you get out of default, combine your loans into a single payment, or change the interest rate on your loan. However, consolidating federal loans may cause you to give up other benefits. Borrowers should talk to their servicers or trusted financial advisor about the risks associated with consolidation. If you are thinking about consolidating your federal student loans into a federal Direct Consolidation Loan , here are some questions to ask yourself:\n\nThe PSLF Program forgives the remaining balance on your Direct Loans after you have made 120 qualifying monthly payments under a qualifying repayment plan while working full-time for a qualifying employer. However, consolidating a Direct Loan where qualifying payments have been made with a Direct Loan that has zero qualifying payments may decrease the total number of qualified payments credited to your new consolidation loan.\n\nOther federal student loans that are ineligible for the PSLF Program ˗ such as Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program loans, Federal Perkins Loans ( Perkins Loan ), and Parent PLUS loans ˗ may become eligible if you consolidate them into a Direct Consolidation Loan.\n\nA Direct Consolidation Loan could make you eligible for several repayment plans that may not be currently available to you. If you have federal loans through the FFEL program, Parent PLUS loan program, or the Perkins loan program, you may be able to consolidate those loans to qualify for one or more income-driven repayment programs. However, consolidating federal Perkins loans may cause you to give up other benefits. Borrowers with Perkins loans can talk to their schools or servicers about consolidation.\n\nIf you’re planning to enroll in an income-driven repayment plan and work with multiple servicers, it might be easier to have a consolidation loan, so you won’t need to submit documents about your income and household size to multiple servicers.\n\nConsolidation allows you to pay off defaulted federal loans with a new loan and new repayment terms. If you cannot afford to repay your loan in full, consolidation is the fastest way to get out of default and enroll in one of the U.S. Department of Education’s other payment plans.\n\nLoan consolidation can simplify your monthly payments by combining multiple loans into one loan. After consolidating your loans, you will only have to make a payment to one student loan servicer . This may make it easier to keep track of your student loans and help manage your finances.\n\nSome older federal student loans have a variable interest rate. If you have a variable rate student loan, your interest rate can go up or down over time. Direct Consolidation Loans have a fixed interest rate, meaning your interest rate will not change over the life of the loan.\n\nThe fixed interest rate for a Direct Consolidation Loan is the weighted average of the interest rates of the loans being consolidated, rounded up to the nearest one-eighth of a percent. While consolidating your loans may slightly increase your interest rate, it will lock you into a fixed interest rate, so your new payment going forward won’t change."

    "url": "https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/how-is-my-student-loan-payment-applied-to-my-account-en-605/",
    "question": "How is my student loan payment applied to my account?",
    "answer": "Generally, payments go first to fees that are owed (late fees, phone payment fees, etc.), then to interest (including past due interest), then to the principal balance of your loan.\n\nIf you plan to pay more than your minimum monthly payment, you can instruct your lender or servicer to apply the excess payment directly to the principal balance. This will lower the total cost of your loan and get you out of debt faster.\n\nWarning: Sometimes, when you pay more than your monthly payment, your lender or servicer will “credit” the amount against a future payment rather than apply it toward your principal balance. This is called “paid ahead status” and is most common with federal loans; however, you can request that your servicer not put your loans in paid ahead status. For example, say you have a loan with a monthly payment of $115, and in January you decide to pay $300. If your lender is crediting your payments forward, in February you would get a statement that showed no payment due; in March, you would get your next actual bill, for $65. This allows you to skip a payment in February, but you won’t get ahead in paying off your loan. Removing paid ahead status and making a principal-only payment may help you pay off your loan quicker."

    "answer": "Yes, and paying more than your monthly minimum can help you to reduce your loan balance quicker.\n\nLenders typically call this “prepayment.” In general, you are entitled to make a payment to your account at any time, without penalty. Check with your loan servicer first to see how additional payments are applied.\n\nWarning: Sometimes, when you pay more than your monthly payment, your lender will “credit” the amount against a future payment rather than apply it toward your loan balance.

    "answer": "Yes, you can pay your student loan in full at any time.\n\nIf you are financially able to do so, it may make sense for you to pay off your student loans early to save money on interest. Lenders typically call this “prepayment in full.” Generally, there are no penalties involved in paying off your student loans early. However, make sure you know how much you currently owe. Check with your loan servicer to get a “payoff quote,” which is an estimate of how much you need to pay in order to pay the loan in full. Generally, your payoff quote is good for several days.\n\nHere are some ideas for saving time and money on student loan repayment."

You can find out who your federal student loan servicer is by logging into your Federal Student Aid account.\n\nUnlike federal student loans, there is not a single website that contains information about all your private student loans. The lender or servicer for each of your loans should provide you with information on how, when, and to whom to pay. This can come in the form of a monthly email, or a billing statement sent to you by mail each month. Some lenders provide a “welcome kit” or phone call when a borrower enters repayment.\n\nTo find information on your private student loans, contact each of your private student loan servicers to determine your total loan balance. The current noteholder, if different from the servicer you send regular payments to, should also have information specific to your loan. The noteholder is the entity who owns your loan.

    "question": "How long does it take to pay off a student loan?",
    "answer": "It depends on your repayment plan and loan terms. Ask your loan servicer what student loan repayment plans are available to you. Your options will be different depending on whether you have federal or private student loans.\n\nIf you have federal student loans, you can choose from several repayment plans that may be available to you. If you do not pick a repayment plan, you loan servicer will automatically place you in a 10-year fixed repayment plan. To learn more about the following options, contact your loan servicer .\n\nStandard repayment\n\nPayments are the same each month. All federal borrowers are automatically enrolled in this plan.\n\n120 months (10 years, or up to 30 years for consolidation loans)\n\nAll federal loan borrowers are eligible. This generally results in the highest monthly payment but the lowest cost over the life of the loan.\n\nGraduated repayment\n\nGraduated repayment is for borrowers who expect their incomes to rise over time.\n\nUp to 10 years (up to 30 years for consolidation loans)\n\nAll federal loan borrowers are eligible. Payments start off low and generally increase every two years. You will pay more interest over time than under the standard repayment plan.\n\nExtended repayment\n\nExtended repayment is available to borrowers with more than $30,000 in federal student loans.\n\nUp to 25 years\n\nIf you extend the term of your loan, you will pay substantially more interest over time, but your payments will be significantly smaller.\n\nIncome-Driven Repayment Plans\n\nIf you repay your loan under an income-driven repayment plan, you may be eligible for loan forgiveness after 20 or 25 years of qualifying payments. Under the SAVE plan, you can be eligible for loan forgiveness after 10 years of qualifying payments, if you borrowed $12,000 or less. If you borrowed more than $12,000, then your repayment term will rise by one year for every additional $1,000 you owe. The maximum repayment term for borrowers with only undergraduate loans is 20 years and 25 years for any borrowers with graduate school loans.\n\nIncome-driven repayment plans cap your monthly payments at a certain percentage of your discretionary income. Your monthly payment may change as your income or family size changes. You must submit paperwork each year to “recertify” your income and family size to stay enrolled in your income-driven repayment plan.\n\nUnlike for federal student loans, there is no standard repayment schedule for private student loans. Generally speaking, many private student loans give you 120 months (10 years) to repay. However, some private student loan terms have you repay over 25 years. Check the terms and conditions of your loan or contact your servicer for more details on how long it will take you to repay your private student loans.\n\nYou may have options to lower your monthly payment. Many private student loan lenders have alternative payment programs for borrowers who might not be able to make a full payment. These plans may include:\n\nAsking for help when you run into trouble can keep you from falling further behind. Contact your student loan servicer and ask what options are available to you. Keep good records of communications and transactions associated with your loans."

    "answer": "Consolidating multiple private loans into a private consolidation loan may be a good idea if you get a better rate and prefer one monthly loan payment.\n\nPrivate loan consolidation combines multiple existing private student loans into one larger loan, refinancing your original private student loans with a new loan. You will have a single monthly payment, which may make paying your bills simpler. Private student lenders may offer an interest rate reduction for creditworthy borrowers seeking to consolidate their private student loans. This can save you money over the lifetime of your loan.\n\nPrivate consolidation loans may have variable interest rates – meaning your interest rate can go up and down over the life of the loan. The interest rate offered by the lender will depend on your credit score. The repayment term, or maximum number of years you have to repay the loan, can vary from 10 to 25 years depending on the lender and the total amount of the loans being consolidated.

If you extend the term of your loan, you will pay more interest over time, but your monthly payments will be smaller.\n\nYou can always pay more than the amount due each month. If you can afford to do so, making extra payments will reduce the total interest you pay over the life of the loan.\n\nThere are some restrictions to enrolling in an Extended Repayment Plan (e.g., this plan does not qualify for loan forgiveness programs), so contact your servicer for more details about converting to this plan.\n\nAs an alternative, an income-driven repayment plan may offer less restrictive options to lower your monthly payment.\n\nIf you are having trouble repaying your federal student loans, you may be eligible for a lower monthly payment, possibly as low as $0, through an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan. These plans allow repayment flexibility based on your income (or lack thereof).

If you believe you do not owe the debt , you should tell the debt collector.\n\nThe CFPB prepared sample letters that you can use to respond to a debt collector who is trying to collect a debt along with tips on how to use them. The sample letters may help you to get information, set ground rules about any further communication, or protect some of your rights.\n\nIf you have private student loans, there are no standard options for dealing with a collection agency on a private student loan, other than paying what is owed. However, you may be able to negotiate or set up a payment plan .\n\nFor private student loan borrowers in default, it is important to remember that there are major differences between federal and private student loans. A debt collector seeking to recover a private student loan does not work for, represent, or collect on behalf of the U.S. Department of Education or any other branch of the federal government. A debt collector trying to collect payments on a private student loan generally may not:\n\nFederal student loans\n\nIf you have federal student loans, you may have additional options in dealing with a federal student loan collector:\n\nIf a debt collector refuses to offer you an option for which you believe you qualify, ask to speak with the debt collector's Special Assistance Unit. If your issue has not been resolved through the servicer's Special Assistance Unit, you may wish to review your options through the Federal Student Aid Ombudsman Group at the U.S. Department of Education."

    "question": "What happens if I default on a federal student loan?",
    "answer": "If your loan holder is unable to obtain payment from you for 270 days, they will take steps to place the loan in default and attempt to collect on the loan.\n\nDefault is the failure to repay a loan according to the terms agreed to in the promissory note. For most federal student loans, you default if you have not made a payment in more than 270 days.\n\nIf you haven’t made a payment on your federal student loan for at least 270 days (nine months), and you have not entered into an agreement with your lender or servicer to postpone your payments (like deferment or forbearance), you are probably in default.\n\nDuring the months in which you miss payments on your federal student loans, your servicer must exercise \"due diligence\" in attempting to collect the loan. Your servicer must make repeated efforts to locate and contact you about repayment.\n\nIf you have not received a letter from your servicer and you believe you could be in default, contact your servicer immediately. Ask about repayment options and find out if it is possible for you to avoid default.\n\nOnce your federal student loan goes into default, you could face a number of consequences:\n\nYou may not receive additional federal student aid if you are in default on a federal student loan until you take steps to bring your federal student loan out of default.\n\nIf you are behind on your federal student loan payments and being contacted by a debt collector, you may be able to arrange repayment options to get out of default.\n\nAn income-come driven repayment plan called Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan has unique benefits that lower payments for many borrowers. Some changes include an interest benefit that went into effect in the summer of 2023, and additional benefits go into effect in July 2024."

    "question": "If I co-signed for a student loan and it has gone into default, what happens?",
    "answer": "The student is the primary borrower with the responsibility to pay back the loan, but as a co-signer you have equal responsibility for repaying the loan if the student doesn’t. If the primary borrower defaults on the loan, it could impact your credit.\n\nAny late or missed payments are reflected on both your credit report and the student’s. If the student defaults on the loan , private lenders will often hire collection agencies to get you to repay, and they may also sue you in court. Lenders can also report your default to consumer reporting agencies, which could harm your credit.\n\nRemember that you have rights when dealing with debt collectors , and it is against the law for a collector to harass you or make false statements to you.\n\nSee your options for dealing with default on a co-signed student loan ."

    "question": "What happens if I default on a private student loan?",
    "answer": "If you’re unable to make your private student loan payments, the lender can report your default to consumer reporting agencies, which could harm your credit. They may take different actions to collect the debt.\n\nIf you are worried you won’t be able to pay your private student loan, contact your lender or servicer as soon as possible. You may be able to negotiate with your lender to set up a new repayment plan or otherwise settle your debt .\n\nPrivate student loans often go into default when you miss monthly payments. Depending on the terms of your loan, you can also default on a private student loan if you declare bankruptcy or default on another loan.\n\nPrivate lenders may attempt to collect on your debt directly, or they may hire collection agencies to try to collect on your debt. In addition, they may take you to court within the statute of limitations. A statute of limitations legally sets the maximum amount of time when a lawsuit can be filed upon default of your student loan. The statute of limitations for private student loans varies from state to state.\n\nAfter the statute of limitations has expired, the private lender is no longer legally allowed to sue you to collect the debt.\n\nYou should review your private loan contracts carefully to better understand what rights you have if you are worried about going into default. If you have not received a letter from your servicer and you believe you may be in default, you should consider contacting your servicer immediately to discuss repayment options and determine if it is possible for you to avoid default."

    "question": "What is a Truth-in-Lending disclosure for an auto loan?",
    "answer": "The federal Truth-in-Lending Act (TILA) requires lenders and dealers to provide you with certain disclosures – before you sign your contract – that explain your auto loan’s costs and terms.\n\nWhen you’re purchasing a car or vehicle, TILA requires that your lender or dealer provide you with specific disclosures. These include the interest rate on the loan and other important costs that will make up your total loan amount, what you’ll pay in finance charges and interest over the life of your loan, and the amount of your monthly payment.\n\nThe TILA disclosures will also include other important information, such as the number of payments, late fees , whether you can prepay your loan without a penalty , and other important terms.\n\nYour TILA disclosure is often provided with your loan contract. However, you should request it before you sign your contract so you can review it in detail and make sure you understand all of the information. You also want to make sure it aligns with the information and rates you’ve been given and that there are no hidden costs. TILA also requires that borrowers be provided with a fully filled in form and not a blank disclosure for consideration.\n\nIf you feel uncomfortable or pressured into signing, you can always walk away. If you experience any issues with receiving your Truth-in-Lending disclosures, you can submit a complaint with the CFPB.\n\nBefore you drive away from the dealership, make sure the paperwork matches the deal you think you’re getting and that you have received copies of all the final documents."
