    "question": "Dropping Courses vs. Withdrawing - UGA Student Financial Aid",
    "answer": "Dropping a course(s) prior to the last date of the official Drop / Add period results in a reevaluation of the student\u2019s Enrollment Status for Financial Aid Purposes and his or her financial aid eligibility for that term. Credit hours for dropped courses are not included in determining a student\u2019s enrollment status for Federal Student Aid (FSA) . Neither do they count for HOPE and Zell Miller Scholarships or UGA scholarship eligibility determination purposes, nor are they included in determining the student\u2019s Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) . No courses or grades are posted to the student\u2019s academic transcript for dropped hours. Any tuition and any related fee charges for the dropped course(s) are returned to the appropriate financial aid program(s). Student repayment may be required if financial aid was previously disbursed to the student based on the subsequently dropped credit hours. Also see the Office of the Registrar\u2019s Registration Overview for more information about the registration process. Summer Pell Grant recipients should review the \u201cImportant Note\u201d at the bottom of this page. Withdrawing from a course(s) following the end of the semester\u2019s Drop / Add period historically resulted in the assignment of a grade of W,WP,or WF.\u00a0 Effective the Fall Semester of 2014, students who withdraw from courses before the semester\u2019s withdrawal deadline will receive a W grade. All types of W grades and the course hours associated with them are still considered as attempted hours for the purposes of determining Federal Student Aid (FSA) , State of Georgia aid (such as the HOPE and Zell Miller Scholarships ) and UGA scholarship eligibility, and they are included in both the quantitative and qualitative portions of the financial aid Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) standards. Also see the Office of the Registrar\u2019s Policy on Withdrawals for more information about the withdrawal process. Summer Pell Grant recipients should review the \u201cImportant Note\u201d at the bottom of this page. Withdrawing from all courses can affect a student\u2019s financial aid eligibility as cited under the preceding topic. In addition, when a student withdraws or is withdrawn from all his or her courses prior to completing more than 60 percent of the term, federal financial aid regulations generally require the student to repay a portion of the federal student aid received during the term. The amount of any required aid repayment is calculated by UGA Student Accounts according to the federally prescribed formula. Also see the Office of the Registrar\u2019s Policy on Withdrawals for more information about the withdrawal process. If a student drops or withdraws from a course prior to the end of the Short Session II drop / add period then that course must be removed from Pell Grant enrollment status. Please review the Office of the Registrar\u2019s Academic Calendar to determine the end of the Short Session II drop / add period. Any classes dropped or withdrawn prior to this date cannot be counted for Pell Grant enrollment status. For example, if you enroll in 12 hours during Summer term and withdraw from 3 hours before the end of the Short Session II drop / add period, you will be considered \u00be time for Pell Grant purposes. This may result in a Pell Grant repayment if you have already received Summer Pell Grant for 12 hours.",

    "question": "Grade Changes & Incomplete (I) Grades - UGA Student Financial Aid",
    "answer": "When a student\u2019s previously posted end of term grade is changed, his or her HOPE / Zell Miller Scholarship Grade Point Average (GPA) is reevaluated as well as the student\u2019s Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) for HOPE / Zell and Federal Student Aid (FSA) . The reevaluation begins with the term to which the grade change applied. If the grade change negatively impacts the student\u2019s HOPE / Zell Miller Scholarship and/or FSA eligibility, the student will be required to repay any affected financial aid already received and any undisbursed aid will be canceled. Although the University\u2019s academic policy provides students up to 12 months to complete an incomplete (I) grade, one or more \u201cI\u201d grades can adversely affect the Minimum 67% Pace of Completion component of Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) .

Generally, a previously passed course can be repeated only once and the course be included in determining the student\u2019s enrollment status. A repeated course can be included in determining your enrollment status under the following circumstances: Your enrollment status for Federal Student Aid (FSA) will be recalculated if you enroll in a course that cannot be included in determining your enrollment status.

Students who wish their Cost of Attendance (COA) to be increased due to additional study abroad expenses can complete the COA Adjustment Request Form . Due to FSA limits, the addition of study abroad expenses may not result in additional financial aid eligibility.

UGA students awarded the HOPE Scholarship enrolled in a UGA study abroad program will be eligible for the UGA HOPE Scholarship Award Amount payable based on the total number of eligible hours in which they are enrolled that semester. UGA students awarded the Zell Miller Scholarship enrolled in a UGA study abroad program will be awarded an amount equal to the current UGA standard Undergraduate tuition charge on a per credit hour basis.

    "question": "Unofficial Withdrawal - UGA Student Financial Aid",
    "answer": "Federal policy requires students who have been awarded any type of Federal Student Aid (FSA) to fulfill their academic requirements. If a student fails to earn a passing grade in at least one course he or she enrolled in for a semester, the UGA Office of Student Financial Aid (OSFA) must assume for FSA purposes that the student has unofficially withdrawn, unless it can be documented that the student did complete the term. For example, a student receives all \u201cF\u201d and/or \u201cU\u201d and/or \u201cW\u201d grades for a term. OSFA is required to determine if the student \u201cunofficially withdrew\u201d from the University. An \u201cunofficial withdrawal\u201d occurs when a student stops attending all classes and stops participating in any academic activities beyond the date he/she last attended classes. Depending on the date of the student\u2019s \u201cunofficial withdrawal\u201d, it may be necessary for the University and/or the student to return some or all of the financial aid the student received during the term. At the end of each semester, OSFA will contact the instructors of such students to find out if the student began attendance in the class and had any academic participation, so OSFA can determine if their failure to earn a passing grade during the term constitutes an \u201cunofficial withdrawal\u201d from the University. Unofficially withdrawing from the University can result in the student being required to repay all or a portion of the financial aid received for the term. Also review the Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) policy for information regarding the potential adverse impact of these grades on continued financial aid eligibility.",

UGA graduate and professional school departments generally do not enter their student assistant tuition waivers into the University\u2019s student information system (Athena) until after OSFA has already packaged the students\u2019 financial aid Awards.

As reflected in Basic Student Eligibility for Federal Student Aid (FSA), students must have been accepted for admission to a UGA degree-seeking program by the Office of Undergraduate Admissions , or the UGA Graduate School , or one of the UGA professional schools ( School of Law , the College of Veterinary Medicine , and the College of Pharmacy ); however, a student not enrolled in a degree program may be eligible for Federal Direct Subsidized/Unsubsidized Loans (and a parent may receive Direct Parent PLUS Loans on behalf of a dependent student ) for up to 12 consecutive months if the student is enrolled at least half-time in coursework necessary for enrollment into an eligible program. Students only taking courses to raise their GPAs in order to be admitted to the program and students who have previously received Federal Direct Loans for preparatory course work at UGA or another institution do not qualify. Student aid applicants pursuing required preparatory coursework to be accepted to a UGA degree program need to print the UGA Office of Student Financial Aid Preparatory Course Work Form (PDF) , complete, sign, and forward it to the Academic Advisor or Department Head of the UGA program to which they are preparing to apply. Student aid applicants pursuing preparatory coursework to be accepted to another college or university\u2019s degree program need to print the UGA Office of Student Financial Aid Preparatory Course Work Form \u2013 Non UGA (PDF) , complete, sign, and forward it to the Academic Advisor or Department Head of the other institution\u2019s program to which they are preparing to apply. Student aid applicants who are not admitted to an eligible UGA degree program, but are pursuing the courses required for elementary or secondary teacher certification or recertification in the state where the student plans to teach, and are enrolled at least half-time may qualify for Federal Direct Subsidized / Unsubsidized Loans and Federal Work-Study . Students must complete the UGA OSFA Teacher Certification Form (PDF) and forward it to their UGA Academic Advisor or Department Head for completion. Once OSFA receives the completed form from the Academic Advisor or Department Head, and the student has completed the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) process , OSFA will award the student the financial aid for which he or she qualifies.",

    "question": "Privacy - UGA Student Financial Aid",
    "answer": "There are numerous federal laws that control the release of student data and the different laws impact the Office of Student Financial Aid\u2019s (OSFA) use of this information in different ways, depending on the source of data and whether personally identifiable information (PII) (information that can be used to identify an individual, i.e., name, address, SSN, DOB, place of birth, any information that alone or in combination is linked or linkable to a specific student that would allow a reasonable person in the school community, who does not have personal knowledge of the relevant circumstances, to identify the student with reasonable certainty) has been properly de-identified. 1. Section 483(a)(3)(E) of the Higher Education Act(HEA) as amended specifically restricts the use of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) data (including Award, estimated Cost of Attendance (COA), Expected Family Contribution (EFC), Student Aid Index (SAI), or financial need), and states that data collected on the FAFSA form shall be used only for the application, award, and administration of aid awarded under: The only permissible method for most third parties to receive FAFSA information under HEA is directly from the student; OSFA cannot provide this information even with the student\u2019s written permission. However, appropriations legislation in 2018 and 2019 [1] included amendments to this section of the HEA to allow institutions to share a student\u2019s FAFSA data with scholarship-granting organizations and tribal organizations to assist with the application, awarding, or administration of scholarship programs (or for assisting the student in applying for assistance that would pay for items in a student\u2019s official Title IV cost of attendance), but only if the student provides explicit written consent authorizing the release of such data. 2. Section 485B(d)(2) of the HEA as amended also prohibits the use of NSLDS data for non-governmental research and marketing purposes. 3. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy ACT (FERPA), 20 U.S.C. Section 1232g and 34 CFR Part 99 protects the privacy of students, in part by prohibiting postsecondary institutions from disclosing PII contained in education records to any third party \u2013 including the student\u2019s parents \u2013without the student\u2019s written permissions. 4. The Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C Section 552 governs the collection, maintenance, and use of records maintained by federal agencies and generally prohibits agencies from disclosing data contained in those records. The Privacy Act imposes restrictions on the University when a federal agency lawfully provides the University records to access to records. 5. The Student Aid Internet Gateway (SAIG) Enrollment Agreement , requires the University to: 6. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GBLA), 15 U.S.C. Section 6801 as well as the University\u2019s Program Participation Agreement (PPA) states institutions must protect student financial aid information, with particular attention to information provided to institutions by ED or otherwise obtained in support of the administration of the Federal Student Aid (FSA) programs authorized under Title IV of the HEA, as amended. 7. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-171 identifies recommended requirements for ensuring the appropriate long-term security of certain Federal Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) in the possession of institutions. 8. ED\u2019s Privacy Technical Assistance Center\u2019s (PTAC) \u201cGuidance on the Use of Financial Aid Information for Program Evaluation and Research \u201d discusses the legal requirements and restrictions under these various Federal statutes and regulations.

    "question": "Private (Alternative) Education Loans - UGA Student Financial Aid",
    "answer": "Students who wish to apply for a private education loan should contact their bank, credit union or other private lending institution to ascertain if they provide private (alternative) education loans. During the most recent Award Year , students enrolled in UGA degree programs received private education loans from these lenders . The lenders are presented in random order. UGA does not endorse or recommend any private education loan company and this is not a preferred lender list and is provided only as a courtesy. Students are free to use a lender not on this list. UGA receives no benefits from any lender. Students may also conduct an internet search for \u201cprivate student loans\u201d. Since the lenders determine their respective application process, interest rates, repayment options and applicable fees we strongly recommend students compare these factors before applying for any private loan.

    "question": "Professional Judgment (PJ) - UGA Student Financial Aid",
    "answer": "Federal regulations allow limited exceptions or adjustments to information reported on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Such exceptions or adjustments, known as \u201cProfessional Judgment\u201d. Professional Judgment requests are considered on a case-by-case basis based on supporting documentation of your circumstances. Whether any adjustments are made is at the sole discretion of the Office of Student Financial Aid (OSFA), and cannot be appealed beyond OSFA. Areas in which adjustments can be considered: The following are areas that generally are not considered: All correspondence from our office will be through email to the student\u2019s UGAMail account. Dependency Override (Unusual Circumstance) The Cost of Attendance (COA) is an estimate of the total amount of your educational expenses for the period of enrollment during the Award Year and is reflected on your financial aid Award. The COA is based on your enrollment status and level, whether you are a Georgia resident, your program of study, and whether you live on or off campus while attending the University. Your assigned Fall & Spring COA initially assumes full-time enrollment and includes: Students may request an increase to their Financial Aid COA by submitting a formal appeal. If approved, the increase typically allows the student to borrow additional loan funds, subject to annual loan limits and/or credit approval (for PLUS or private loans). Because COA increases must typically be determined after an expense is incurred, students may wish to contact the Office of Student Financial Aid (OSFA) and determine in advance whether a cost would be approved prior to incurring that cost. Below are the allowable expenses for which an increase to the Financial Aid Cost of Attendance may be appealed: Students who are required to commute a significant distance for enrolled classes, related non-classwork, required experiential learning site, or internships can submit a request to OSFA. A student must provide documentation using a recognized mapping website of roundtrip mileage to and from UGA, or similar documentation of such costs. A letter from the student\u2019s advisor or supervisor is required with dates of travel and location if the request is related to non-classwork, required experiential learning site, or an internship. Purchase of a vehicle, auto loan payments, insurance, license, registration, and general car maintenance cannot and will not be considered. Federal regulations permit OSFA to consider the cost to purchase a computer when calculating a student\u2019s COA. Allowable expenses include the purchase cost of a computer, printer, and other necessary software and supplies as long as the expenses are incurred no earlier than 100 days prior to the beginning of the academic year. A maximum of $2500 in computer expenses will be considered once per degree level. For example, a sophomore may receive assistance of $1300 for computer expenses and then request $1200 as a senior. If that same student then enrolls at UGA as a graduate student, a new $2500 limit would apply. The equipment must be purchased in advance and appropriate documentation provided to OSFA before the increase in COA and eligibility for assistance can be considered. In calculating a student\u2019s COA, federal regulations permit OSFA to include an allowance based on expenses incurred for dependent care. The period of time for which the dependent care expenses are incurred must be directly related to the time needed for the student to pursue their education. The dependent must have been included in the student\u2019s number in household on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Students with disability-related expenses may contact OSFA to have such expenses considered. Disability-related expenses include but are not limited to: personal assistance, equipment, and supplies. OSFA may potentially include disability expenses in the COA that are not provided by other assisting agencies. OSFA may consult with the UGA Disability Resource Center and/or other sources to confirm the average cost of such expenses. Documentation of actual expenses may be necessary. OSFA can consider and increase a student\u2019s COA if the student is required to pay for their own individual health insurance cost. Documentation of the actual cost incurred by the student is required. If a student is on a spouse\u2019s or parent\u2019s health insurance policy, we cannot take into consideration those costs because these costs are not paid directly by the student. Students residing on-campus may have the housing component of their Cost of Attendance adjusted to reflect actual charges. Students residing off-campus who incur reasonable housing costs in excess of our estimates may be able to request a possible adjustment in the housing component of their COA.\u00a0 The maximum allowable amount for the 2025-2026 academic year is up to $839 for undergraduate and up to $1,566 for graduate or professional students per month in rent/ utilities, as applicable. OSFA generally does not consider COA increases for medical expenses as there is already an allowance for them built in to the standard cost. Typically, medical expenses are part of the need-analysis calculation on the FAFSA. In the event a student has an extenuating circumstance related to medical expenses, the student should contact the Office of Student Financial Aid to determine if the costs can be considered and what documentation is required. OSFA will not increase the COA for co-pays, deductibles, or any portion of an elective procedure. OSFA may also include the one-time cost of obtaining the first professional credential in a field that requires licensure or certification. This cost must be incurred during a period of enrollment even if the exam is scheduled to be taken after the semester has ended. The cost of test preparation courses cannot be included in a student\u2019s COA. OSFA already includes the following expenses in the COA for students in the PharmD program so they are not eligible for a COA increase: Federal regulations allow OSFA to take into consideration eligible study abroad costs for approved courses of study when determining financial aid eligibility. Charges that exceed the existing estimated budget will be considered. Students who incur education related expenses not listed above should contact OSFA directly for additional information. Example items NOT eligible for COA increases: Students may submit a Cost of Attendance Adjustment Request to the Office of Student Financial Aid (OSFA) by:",

    "question": "Graduate Students - UGA Student Financial Aid",
    "answer": "Federal regulations require educational institutions to establish a Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) Policy for determining if an otherwise eligible financial aid applicant or recipient is making satisfactory academic progress in his or her education program. If he or she is doing so, the student may receive assistance from the Federal Student Aid (FSA) programs. State of Georgia Financial Aid Programs regulations require applicants and recipients to meet the SAP criteria established for Federal Student Aid (FSA) as does OSFA need-based aid . SAP consists of two components of measurement: quantity and quality. The University of Georgia (UGA) Office of Student Financial Aid (OSFA) checks SAP at the end of every semester and prior to awarding aid. Students are no longer eligible for federal and State of Georgia financial aid or OSFA need-based aid once it is determined they are no longer meeting both SAP measurement components. Financial aid applicants and recipients who were previously maintaining SAP but are identified as failing to maintain either the Minimum 67% Pace of Completion or the Measurement of Quality will be placed on Financial Aid Warning status for one semester of enrollment. Students who have reached or exceeded their Maximum Total Attempted Hours or are identified as being unable to complete their degree prior to reaching their Maximum Allowable Total Attempted Hours are not eligible for the one semester on Financial Aid Warning and immediately lose their financial aid eligibility. Minimum 67% Pace of Completion Undergraduate students must successfully complete a minimum of 67%, or two-thirds, of their Total Attempted Hours . 12 successfully completed hours/18 attempted hours=0.6667 Pace of Completion. This student is making SAP because they have successfully completed two thirds of the hours they attempted. Graduate and Professional students are not considered to be making SAP once their Total Attempted Hours reach the maximum number permitted for their degree program, or it is apparent they will be unable to complete their degree before reaching the Maximum Total Attempted Hours permitted for the program. The maximum number of Total Attempted Hours permitted for students pursuing a master\u2019s or specialist degree is 102 (the Master of Science in Business Analytics is allowed 49 instead of 102), and Students with Maximum Total Attempted Hours between 90-101 must be graduating at the end of the next semester of enrollment in order to be making SAP during that semester. The maximum number of Total Attempted Hours permitted for students pursuing the following programs are: In addition, should it become apparent a student will be unable to complete his or her degree before reaching the applicable maximum number of Total Attempted Hours, the student will no longer be considered to be making SAP. Students must maintain a cumulative GPA equal to or above the following minimum GPA on all coursework applicable to their degree level, and taken during their degree program. All graduate and professional programs other than those listed below must maintain a minimum 3.0 cumulative GPA: Students dismissed from a graduate or professional program are not considered to be making SAP. All requirements for the degrees, including the thesis / dissertation and final oral / written examination, must be completed within the maximum timeframe permitted for the degree program comprised of the greater number of credit hours. All hours attempted and all grades received for courses taken more than once count in the student\u2019s Satisfactory Academic Progress calculations. Students who have graduated with a masters, doctoral or professional degree who wish to pursue another degree at the same level are still limited to the number of Maximum Total Attempted Hours applicable to a single degree at the same level. Example A: Student had 71 Total Attempted Hours when she earns her MBA. She is now pursuing a Master in the Study of Law (M.S.L.). Since her Total Attempted Hours already exceed the 45 Total Attempted Hours permitted for the M.S.L., she is not considered to be making SAP. She needs to review the SAP Appeal Policy & Procedures . The measurement of the student\u2019s Minimum 67% Pace of Completion and Measurement of Quality continue to be based on her Total Attempted Hours. Example B: A student who previously pursued a doctoral degree now wishes to pursue either a different doctoral or a professional degree. The student attempted 74 doctoral level hours pursuing the previous degree, so he has accrued 74 Total Attempted Hours at the doctoral level.\u00a0 The maximum number of Total Attempted Hours permitted students pursuing a doctoral degree is 280.5; therefore, the student has 206.5 (280.5 minus 74) doctoral or professional level hours he can attempt before reaching his Maximum Total Attempted Hours (150%). The 74 hours will also be included in calculating the student\u2019s Minimum 67% Pace of Completion and overall cumulative GPA. Hours based on enrollment in Study Abroad, Student Exchange or approved consortium courses are counted toward Total Attempted Hours . These courses will not count as Successfully Completed Hours until the applicable academic transcript reflecting successful completion is received by the appropriate graduate school and grades are entered into Athena. Students should contact the UGA Office of Student Financial Aid (OSFA) once Study Abroad, Student Exchange or Consortium grades are entered so OSFA can determine if the student now meets the Minimum 67% Pace of Completion. SAP is evaluated at the end of every semester. After grades are posted, OSFA e-mails all financial aid recipients informing them of the need to review their SAP status on Athena, which either informs them they are maintaining SAP or provides the reason(s) for their failure to maintain SAP.\u00a0 Those students not maintaining SAP are informed of the specific SAP standard(s) not being met and provided a link to the SAP Appeals Policy & Procedures. Financial Aid Warning status is defined by federal regulation and cannot be altered or modified. Financial aid applicants and recipients who were previously maintaining SAP but are identified as failing to maintain either the Minimum 67% Pace of Completion or the Measurement of Quality will be automatically placed on Financial Aid Warning status for one semester of enrollment. NOTE: EMBA, PMBA, and online MBA students are not eligible for Financial Aid Warning status as they are only checked for SAP once per academic year prior to fall semester. Although students placed on Financial Aid Warning status are no longer making SAP, they are still eligible to receive any federal or state financial aid for which they are otherwise eligible during their one semester on Financial Aid Warning. All financial aid awarded for any semesters subsequent to the Financial Aid Warning semester will be cancelled. Students who have been placed on Financial Aid Warning due to their failure to meet the Minimum 67% Pace of Completion and/or the Measurement of Quality will retain their financial aid eligibility if, at the end of their Financial Aid Warning semester, they are again meeting both of these requirements. Previously cancelled aid for which they are otherwise eligible will be reinstated. See \u201cHow to Regain Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) on Your Own\u201d. Students who have either exceeded their Maximum Total Attempted Hours or cannot regain SAP on their own during their Financial Aid Warning semester should skip the following section and read the SAP Appeal Policy and Procedures . This option applies only to those students not maintaining the Minimum 67% Pace of Completion and/or the Measurement of Quality . This is not an option for students who are nearing or have reached their Maximum Allowable Total Attempted Hours. Federal student aid regulations permit (but do not require) colleges to establish a SAP Appeals Policy. Furthermore, if an institution chooses to implement a SAP policy which permits appeals, it is left solely to the institution to specify when and how such appeals will be permitted as well as how many times a student may appeal. OSFA has established the following SAP Appeals Policy and Procedures to assist students who failed to maintain SAP due to mitigating circumstances . Students may appeal to the Office of Student Financial Aid (OSFA) by: The University of Georgia is committed to the well-being of all of our students. If the appeal you submit indicates you have experienced sexual or relationship violence, the Office of Student Financial Aid will refer it to the Equal Opportunity Office who may contact you with the resources that are available to you. OSFA\u2019s review of student SAP appeals will include consideration of and possible approval of, an individual student academic plan. OSFA may work with students on a case-by-case basis to identify an academic plan designed to get the student back on track and become academically successful. This is the purpose of an academic plan. Depending on the individual student situation, an academic plan may be as simple as a mathematical calculation by OSFA that specifies the percentage of coursework the student must now successfully complete, the minimum grade point average the student must earn each semester, or the maximum number of hours in which the student may enroll in a specified semester. Conversely, the academic plan may be as complicated as a course by course degree plan.\u00a0 In these cases OSFA will instruct the student to meet with his or her UGA academic advisor to formulate a structured plan which clearly sets forth the courses in which the student must enroll, and the minimum GPA he or she must earn each term. The student will then provide a copy of the formal academic plan to OSFA for consideration. Students for whom OSFA grants an appeal with an approved academic plan can receive the federal or state financial aid for which they are otherwise eligible as long as they strictly adhere to their approved plan. Students on an OSFA approved academic plan will be evaluated following each semester of enrollment and his or her failure to meet ALL the requirements of the academic plan will result in immediate loss of financial aid eligibility. Financial Aid Probation status is defined by regulation and cannot be altered or modified. If OSFA finds that the student\u2019s appeal circumstances were sufficiently mitigating, and if either At the end of the semester on Financial Aid Probation, the student must again be meeting either all SAP criteria, or must be meeting all the requirements of his or her OSFA approved Academic Plan in order to continue to be eligible for financial aid. Students whose appeals are approved will continue to be reviewed at the end of each semester to determine if they are meeting all SAP requirements, or are meeting all the requirements of their approved Academic Plan. Students who previously received Federal Direct Student Loans or previously failed to maintain SAP may also be required to complete additional financial counseling before eligibility for student financial aid can be re-established. If otherwise eligible, a student may be awarded Federal Student Aid and state of Georgia financial aid (HOPE Scholarship, Zell Miller Scholarship, etc.) for the semester in which the student is again meeting all the SAP standards, or for which an appeal was approved. When OSFA does not approve a student SAP appeal based on its determination the student did not have sufficient mitigating circumstances , the student may request further consideration by the University\u2019s Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeals Committee. To request further consideration by the University\u2019s Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeals Committee, the student needs only to send OSFA a signed written request (or e-mail from their UGA Mail account). The decision of the University\u2019s Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeals Committee is final. It is important to note that all stipulations and requirements of an OSFA approved Academic Plan are final and are not subject to further consideration by the University\u2019s Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeals Committee.",

    "question": "Undergraduate Students - UGA Student Financial Aid",
    "answer": "Federal statute and regulations require educational institutions to establish a Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) Policy for determining if an otherwise eligible financial aid applicant or recipient is making satisfactory academic progress in his or her education program. If he or she is doing so, the student may receive assistance from the Federal Student Aid (FSA) programs. State of Georgia Financial Aid Programs regulations require applicants and recipients to meet the SAP criteria established for Federal Student Aid (FSA) as does OSFA awarded need-based aid . SAP consists of two components of measurement: quantity and quality. The University of Georgia (UGA) Office of Student Financial Aid (OSFA) checks SAP at the end of every semester and prior to awarding aid. Students are no longer eligible for federal and State of Georgia financial aid once it is determined they are no longer meeting both SAP measurement components. Financial aid applicants and recipients who were previously maintaining SAP but are identified as failing to maintain either the Minimum 67% Pace of Completion or the Measurement of Quality will be placed on Financial Aid Warning for one semester of enrollment during which they can receive the financial aid for which they are otherwise eligible. Students who have reached or exceeded their Maximum Total Attempted Hours or are identified as being unable to complete their degree prior to reaching their Maximum Total Attempted Hours are not eligible for the one semester on Financial Aid Warning and immediately lose their financial aid eligibility. Minimum 67% Pace of Completion Undergraduate students must successfully complete a minimum of 67%, or two-thirds, of their Total Attempted Hours . 12 successfully completed hours/18 attempted hours=0.6667 Pace of Completion. This student is making SAP because they have successfully completed two thirds of the hours they attempted. Undergraduate students are not making SAP once their Total Attempted Hours equal 150% of the number of hours required to complete their undergraduate degree, or once it is apparent they will be unable to complete their undergraduate degree before reaching their applicable Maximum Allowable Total Attempted Hours For most UGA undergraduate degrees, this provides students up to 181 Total Attempted Hours to complete a 121 semester hour degree. The maximum allowable number of attempted hours is proportionally increased for students in degree programs requiring more than 121 hours. If a student has 166-180 Total Attempted Hours at the end of a semester, the student must be graduating at the end of his or her next semester of enrollment; otherwise, the student will have reached his or her Maximum Total Attempted Hours and be ineligible to receive financial aid during his or her next semester of enrollment. All Undergraduate students must have at least a 2.0 Minimum Overall Grade Point Average (GPA) at the end of every semester. SAP policy uses the official grading scale of the University of Georgia (UGA). See the UGA Bulletin for more information on the University\u2019s grading scale. Undergraduate students who change majors during the Academic Year are strongly encouraged not to withdraw from any classes as they are still required to successfully complete the minimum 67% of their Total Attempted Hours . Students who change majors or degree programs are at risk of exceeding their Maximum Total Attempted Hours before obtaining a degree. Students who decide to change majors or degree programs should do so early in their academic career so as not to jeopardize future eligibility for student financial aid at the University. Changing majors is not a justification for failing to maintain SAP. The Maximum Total Attempted Hours allows for any additional attempted hours necessitated by a student\u2019s requirement to enroll in any Academic Assistance / Learning Support courses . Hours based on enrollment in Study Abroad, Student Exchange or approved consortium courses are counted toward Total Attempted Hours . These courses will not count as Successfully Completed Hours until the applicable academic transcript reflecting successful completion is received by the Office of Undergraduate Admissions and grades are entered into Athena . Students should contact the UGA Office of Student Financial Aid (OSFA) once Study Abroad, Student Exchange or consortium grades are entered so OSFA can determine if they now meet the Minimum 67% Pace of Completion. The University\u2019s granting of Academic Renewal does not change or alter the calculation of a student\u2019s Total Attempted Hours . The student\u2019s Total Attempted Hours will continue to be determined in the usual way. Students who have graduated with a baccalaureate degree and wish to pursue a different baccalaureate degree are still limited to the number of Maximum Total Attempted Hours applicable to one baccalaureate degree; the Minimum 67 Percent Pace of Completion, and the Minimum Overall Grade Point Average (GPA) will continue to be calculated using all undergraduate hours accepted for transfer credit plus all hours attempted at UGA. Example: The student has completed a BSED degree and is now seeking an AB degree. She has attempted 147 hours at The University and in transfer which means she is allowed an additional 34 hours of aid eligibility for the second degree before reaching her Maximum Allowable Total Attempted Hours (150%). Also, should it become apparent she will be unable to complete her second degree before reaching her Maximum Allowable Total Attempted Hours, she will no longer be eligible for aid. Otherwise eligible non-degree students (those pursuing approved teacher certification or approved preparatory coursework are subject to the undergraduate SAP requirements. For students simultaneously pursuing two (or more) baccalaureate degrees, the measurement of their Minimum 67% Pace of Completion and Measurement of Quality are still based on their Total Attempted Hours . Their Maximum Total Attempted Hours will be calculated using the degree with the greater number of required hours. If a student registers for and receives a grade in a course for which credit hours have already been granted, either by work at the University or by transfer: The UGA Policy Library is the central resource for University-level policies and procedures, including Repeating a Course . SAP is evaluated at the end of every semester and prior to making a financial aid Award. After grades are posted, OSFA e-mails all financial aid recipients informing them of the need to review their SAP status on Athena, which either informs them they are maintaining SAP or provides the reason(s) for their failure to maintain SAP. Those students not maintaining SAP are informed of the specific SAP standard(s) not being met and provided a link to the SAP Appeal Policy & Procedures. Financial Aid Warning is defined by federal regulation and cannot be altered or modified. Financial aid applicants and recipients who were previously maintaining SAP but are identified as failing to maintain either the Minimum 67% Pace of Completion or the Measurement of Quality will be placed on Financial Aid Warning status for one semester of enrollment. Although students placed on Financial Aid Warning status are no longer making SAP, they are still eligible to receive any federal or state financial aid for which they are otherwise eligible during their one semester on Financial Aid Warning. All financial aid awarded for any semesters subsequent to the Financial Aid Warning semester will be cancelled. Students who have been placed on Financial Aid Warning due to their failure to meet the Minimum 67% Pace of Completion and/or the Measurement of Quality will retain their financial aid eligibility if, at the end of their Financial Aid Warning semester, they are again meeting both of these requirements.

In these cases OSFA will instruct the student to meet with his or her UGA academic advisor to formulate a structured plan which clearly sets forth the courses in which the student must enroll, and the minimum GPA or grades he or she must earn each term. The student will then provide a copy of the formal academic plan to OSFA for consideration. Students for whom OSFA grants an appeal with an approved academic plan can receive the federal or state financial aid for which they are otherwise eligible as long as they strictly adhere to their approved plan. Students on an OSFA approved academic plan will be evaluated following each semester of enrollment and his or her failure to meet ALL the requirements of the academic plan will result in immediate loss of financial aid eligibility. If OSFA finds that the student\u2019s appeal circumstances were sufficiently mitigating, and if either: At the end of the semester on Financial Aid Probation, the student must either be meeting all SAP criteria, or must be meeting all the requirements of his or her OSFA approved Academic Plan in order to continue to be eligible for financial aid. Students whose appeals are approved will continue to be reviewed at the end of each semester to determine if they are meeting all SAP requirements, or are meeting all the requirements of their approved Academic Plan. Students who previously received Federal Direct Student Loans or previously failed to maintain SAP may also be required to complete additional financial counseling before eligibility for student financial aid can be re-established. If otherwise eligible, a student may be awarded Federal Student Aid (FSA) and state of Georgia financial aid (such as HOPE and Zell Miller Scholarships ) for the semester in which the student regained SAP or for which an appeal was approved. When OSFA does not approve a student SAP appeal based on its determination the student did not have sufficient mitigating circumstances , the student may request further consideration by the University\u2019s Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeals Committee. To request further consideration by the University\u2019s Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeals Committee, the student needs only to send OSFA a signed written request (or e-mail from his or her UGA Mail account). The decision of the University\u2019s Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeals Committee is final. It is important to note that all stipulations and requirements of an OSFA approved Academic Plan are final and are not subject to further consideration by the University\u2019s Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeals Committee.",

    "question": "Second Degrees, Double Majors & Dual Degrees - UGA Student Financial Aid",
    "answer": "Students who have earned a Bachelor\u2019s degree are ineligible for the Federal Pell Grant, the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG), and the HOPE and Zell Miller Scholarships. Students are also considered to have earned a Bachelor\u2019s degree if they have completed all of the requirements for the degree, even if they have not yet received the diploma. Students may be eligible for Federal Direct Loans for a second Bachelor\u2019s degree, as long as they meet all other eligibility requirements, and as long as that second degree is a different degree. For example, if a student earns a Bachelor\u2019s of Arts degree from UGA and then decides to pursue a Bachelor\u2019s of Business Administration degree, the student may be eligible for student loan funding. However if a student has earned a Bachelor\u2019s of Arts degree in English from UGA and then decided to pursue a Bachelor\u2019s of Arts degree in Art History, the student would not be eligible for additional funding because the student is pursuing the same degree already earned. Eligible second degree students must adhere to the Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy and are limited by Aggregate Loan Limits . Students do not receive additional financial aid eligibility when pursuing more than one major. Additionally, once students meet the degree requirements to complete one of the majors, they are considered to have earned a degree, even if they are still completing the requirements for their other major. For example, a student is pursuing a Bachelor\u2019s of Business Administration degree with majors in Marketing and Real Estate. At the end of spring semester the student meets the requirements to complete the Marketing degree, but will not finish the Real Estate major until after the end of summer semester. This student is not eligible for any federal or state of Georgia financial aid summer semester, including the HOPE and Zell Miller Scholarships, because the student has already earned a first Bachelor\u2019s degree. Students with more than one major must adhere to the Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy and are limited by Aggregate Loan Limits . Students participating in the Double Dawgs program should refer to the information at OSFA\u2019s Double Dawgs Program page .",

    "question": "Double Dawgs Program - UGA Student Financial Aid",
    "answer": "The Double Dawgs program was created to give ambitious and motivated students a competitive advantage in today\u2019s knowledge economy. By earning both a bachelor\u2019s degree and a master\u2019s degree in five years or less, students can save time and money while positioning themselves for success after graduation. Students who follow the standard Double Dawgs program of study do so in the following format:  Students following the standard Double Dawgs Program of Study above can receive undergraduate-level financial aid , including the Federal Pell Grant and the HOPE and Zell Miller Scholarships, for years 1 through 4 of this Program of Study as long as they remain otherwise eligible. Once the undergraduate degree requirements have been completed or the student is admitted to the graduate program, the student becomes ineligible for all undergraduate aid and will then qualify for graduate-level student financial aid if they are otherwise eligible. Certain students are able to appeal to the Double Dawgs program to be admitted to the graduate portion of the program prior to earning their undergraduate degree, and will be working on their undergraduate and graduate degrees simultaneously. Once admitted to the Graduate School, such students must be considered graduate students for federal student financial aid purposes and no longer qualify for undergraduate federal student financial aid. However, these students remain eligible for state student financial aid as long as they are still degree-seeking in the undergraduate program, have not earned an undergraduate degree, and remain otherwise eligible for the state financial aid. Federal student financial aid can only be used to pay for coursework required for the student\u2019s primary program of study, and federal regulations allow for federal financial aid to pay for only one program at a time in a semester, so students need to work with their academic advisors carefully to determine when the student should seek admission to the Graduate School. Stated another way\u2013federal financial aid can only pay for courses that apply to your degree program, and for only one program at a time in a term. Once a student is admitted to a graduate or professional degree program, they are classified as a graduate student for federal student aid purposes. Per federal regulation, once a student has classified as a graduate / professional student, they are ineligible to receive undergraduate federal financial aid grants. This rule applies generally even if the student subsequently re-enrolls in an undergraduate program; however, such students may still be able to receive federal student loans at the undergraduate level even when they are no longer eligible for undergraduate federal financial aid grants.

    "question": "Overawards & Overpayments - UGA Student Financial Aid",
    "answer": "See Overaward in Important Terms for definition. Federal regulations require colleges to consider all educational financial assistance to be calculated in determining student eligibility. Financial assistance includes grants, loans, scholarships, waivers, fellowships / assistantships, work study, and similar programs used to cover educational expenses. When a student receives more aid than their financial need or cost of attendance, the result may be an overaward. OSFA is required to resolve an overaward which may result in funds being returned to an aid program and a student owing the University a repayment. OSFA will not reduce or cancel the Federal Pell Grant, HOPE, or Zell Miller Scholarships to eliminate an overaward situation. In most cases, student loans will be reduced or cancelled. Federal Work-Study may be cancelled but a student will not need to repay funds already earned. When the total of all aid received by the student exceeds the student\u2019s cost of attendance or financial need, an overaward occurs and awards in the package will be adjusted (cancelled or reduced) in order to eliminate it. Loans will be reduced before any reduction is made to any other awards. The following awards may need to be adjusted to prevent an overaward: Overawards are usually the result of the student receiving aid that OSFA was not aware of when we completed the student\u2019s financial aid package. It is the student\u2019s responsibility to notify OSFA of all additional resources to be received. This should be done as soon as the student becomes aware that they will receive the aid. OSFA must account for all sources of aid, even if they are not processed directly through our office. OSFA is bound by Federal regulation to resolve the overaward. Exceptions cannot be made.",

If the semester(s) for which you are being considered for the Federal Pell Grant has ended, your enrollment status for the semester(s) for which the Pell is being considered will be based on the number of the semester\u2019s Successfully Completed Hours . If you meet the preceding criteria but were selected for and have not completed Verification of FAFSA Information by the time you are no longer enrolled that Award Year, you MAY be eligible once you complete verification if the Annual Verification Deadline has not passed. To be considered for a retroactive Federal Direct Loans for fall, spring or summer of the Award Year: If you are nearing the end of a semester and wish to request a Federal Direct Loan for that semester, you should contact OSFA and ask to speak with a Counselor who can advise you if the loan can still be awarded.",

Male students age 18 through 25 who have not yet registered with the SSS can do so on the Selective Service System Web site. Males age 26 or older are not permitted to register with Selective Service and are considered not eligible for State of Georgia student financial aid.

    "question": "U.S. Citizenship & Eligible Non-Citizens - UGA Student Financial Aid",
    "answer": "A student must be one of the following to be eligible to receive Federal Student Aid (FSA) or State of Georgia Financial Aid: Additionally, the State of Georgia Financial Aid Programs require the eligible non-citizen status to have been granted from 12 to 24 months prior to the first day of classes of the term for which the student wishes to receive the state aid. A parent of a dependent student who wishes to borrow a Federal Direct Parent PLUS Loan must also be a U.S. citizen or eligible non-citizen. The U.S. Department of Education matches all Free Applications for Federal Student Aid (FAFSAs) with the Social Security Administration. All FAFSAs with Alien Registration Numbers (ARNs) are also matched with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) / United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) data base. U.S. Citizen: If the Social Security Administration is unable to electronically confirm a student\u2019s U.S. Citizenship during FAFSA processing, the student must provide original documents to the UGA Office of Student Financial Aid (OSFA) confirming citizenship before any Federal Student Aid (FSA) funds can be disbursed. A Social Security card or driver\u2019s license isn\u2019t acceptable for documenting U.S. citizenship or national status since noncitizens and non-nationals can also have these forms of identification. Acceptable forms of U.S. citizenship documentation are: Eligible Non-Citizens: If the DHS / USCIS is unable to confirm a student\u2019s eligible noncitizen status during FAFSA processing, the student must provide original documents to the UGA Office of Student Financial Aid (OSFA) confirming eligible non-citizen status. Federal Student Aid (FSA) eligible noncitizen statuses are: Acceptable forms of documentation are: Citizens of the Federated States of Micronesia and the republics of Palau and Marshall Islands. Note: Citizens of Palau are eligible only for the Federal Pell Grant, Federal Supplemental Opportunity Grant or Federal Work-Study (FWS). Citizens of Micronesia and the Marshall Islands are only eligible for the Federal Pell Grant. None of these students are eligible for Federal Direct Student Loans. Persons with non-immigrant visas (includes those with work visas, students, visitors and foreign government officials) are not eligible for Federal Student Aid (FSA) or State of Georgia Financial Aid . Following are some examples of these types of Visas and statuses which are not eligible for financial assistance administered by this office, but the list is not all inclusive: This information is provided in an effort to direct ineligible non-citizen students to potential providers of assistance. International students who are in need of assistance can contact the UGA Office of Global Engagement . International students should contact the department in which they plan to study to check for departmental scholarships, assistantships, or stipends. International students should research companies, organizations, or the government from their home country as possible sources of funding.

A student\u2019s Cost of Attendance (COA) includes a component for tuition and fee expenses; therefore, federal and State of Georgia regulations require the dollar value of any tuition or fee waiver(s) students receive to be treated as a financial resource when determining their eligibility for Federal Student Aid (FSA), some State of Georgia aid and OSFA Need-Based Aid . When students receive a waiver of in-state and/or an out-of-state tuition or student fees after having been awarded financial aid, they may be required to repay already disbursed aid in order to reduce or eliminate an overaward .

    "question": "Verification of Free Application Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) Information - UGA Student Financial Aid",
    "answer": "The U.S. Department of Education (ED) created the Verification process to confirm the accuracy of information provided on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) . By federal regulation, the post-secondary institution in which the student is enrolled is responsible for conducting the verification process on behalf of ED. The UGA Office of Student Financial Aid (OSFA) cannot award UGA students selected for verification any Federal Student Aid (FSA) until the students complete the Verification process and OSFA has transmitted to and subsequently received any necessary FAFSA corrections from ED. Students who only wish to apply for the HOPE or Zell Miller Scholarships do not need to complete the Verification process. When a FAFSA is selected for the Verification process, OSFA will notify the student via their UGAMail account and the parent (when applicable) via the parent e-mail address provided on the student\u2019s FAFSA. Verification requirements can be viewed in Athena . The UGA Office of Student Financial Aid (OSFA) utilizes the OSFA Secure Portal for students and parents to upload required documentation (such as tax documentation) to complete the Federal Student Financial Aid application process. If selected for the Verification process, students will find additional instructions on accessing the OSFA Secure Portal in Athena under the Student Requirements section. Please note that students may have additional requirements (in addition to the Verification process) which can be viewed in Athena under the Eligibility Requirements section. Verification processing can take up to 2 weeks once all supporting documentation is received (note that during peak processing times [i.e., June through September] processing times can take up to 4 weeks). Please note that Verification processing does not begin until all required documentation has been received. Therefore, students should begin the Verification process as early as possible to prevent processing delays. The U.S. Department of Education (ED) establishes a deadline after which the Verification process can no longer be completed for the applicable academic year. Students and parents must submit to the UGA Office of Student Financial Aid (OSFA) all documentation necessary to complete the Verification process by the earlier of either : Example: A student completes their 2025-26 FAFSA prior to the Fall Semester 2025. Their FAFSA is selected for verification and OSFA e-mails the student requesting verification documentation. The student attends the Fall Semester 2025 which ends December 10, 2025. They do not enroll for the Spring Semester 2026. OSFA must receive all requested documentation no later than 120 calendar days following December 10, 2025, since that is earlier than the September 1, 2026 deadline. A student\u2019s failure to provide all requested documentation prior to the Annual Verification Deadline (earlier of the two dates listed above) will result in the student not being awarded any Federal Student Aid (FSA) for the Award Year. Also see Retroactive Federal Student Aid for additional deadlines affecting the awarding of FSA\u00a0 once the Award Year begins and after a student is no longer enrolled in the Award Year.",
